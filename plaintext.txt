The corresponding dimensions of A and B must be equal to each other or equal to one. Whenever a dimension of A or B is singleton (equal to one), bsxfun virtually replicates the array along that dimension to match the other array. In the case where a dimension of A or B is singleton, and the corresponding dimension in the other array is zero, bsxfun virtually diminishes the singleton dimension to zero.
